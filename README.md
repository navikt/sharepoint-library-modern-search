## pnp - Extensibility Library for NAV

This spfx library adds functionality to PnP Modern Search web parts specifically for NAV. The library is based on the demo library described in the documentation. Therefore, it is loaded automatically by all PnP Modern Search web parts.

Currently, this library provides two layouts for the search results web part: "NAV Nyheter" and "NAV Driftsmeldinger". [They are documented on Navet](https://navno.sharepoint.com/sites/intranett-kommunikasjon/SitePages/PnP-Modern-Search---Search-results.aspx)
